1.you must change the first line in main.py before running

2.there are just several examples in single_obj and multi_obj,
you can test other benchmark functions by yourself (refer to saopy\function_evaluation\benchmark_func.py)
run_result_example shows one example after running main.py, you cannot get the same results if you run main.py again because of random in the program, but the trend of convergence should be similar
